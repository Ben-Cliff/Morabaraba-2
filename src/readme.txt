:: What we have here
Running the ".bat" file assumes you have python installed on your computer.

:: Python Version
Ernest used Python version 3.6.5 from python.org

:: Visual Studio
Note that there are a few things for this, firstly:
Version: Visual Studio 2017

Note that there are slight adjustments to Ernest's Visual Studio install, if it doesnt work currently we must look at the "added features".

Note on first project launch you will likely have an error loading the VS project, just "right-click" on the "play_me (unavailable)" and select the option to install the extensions. (You need to close Visual Studio windows, e.g. the project, to have the installer run after you open it)

Also note: Visual Studio doesnt "start" the project to run currently so use a "click" on the bat file or something.
